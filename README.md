# steam-free-packages
steam-free-packages is a NodeJS application used to periodically request free packages on steam to be added to your account (50 per 30 mins).

Made as replacement for the deprecated free packages script provided by SteamDB.

That script no longer works due to Valve's recent changes that added rate restrictions.

To use steam-free-packages:

1. Download and Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Download [this repository](https://github.com/Royalgamer06/steam-free-packages/archive/master.zip)
3. Extract it anywhere and run install.bat (one-time only) to install the needed libraries
4. Edit config.json and include your information and preferences
5. Run run.bat any time after completing step 1-4
6. Minimize if you wish and it will periodically request free packages for your steam account

Good luck!
